      %p Quite a while ago I idealized this project, obivously inspired with the popularity of twitch, but was not until April 2015 that the development really kicked off.
      %p Codewatch.tv is not the first application of its type on the market, but the intention is to fill some of the gaps and introduce new and fresh functionality.
      %p This project, apart from initial help from my collegues Carlo Scarioni and Jorja Hung, was fully developed and currently maintained by me.
